# Implementation #
## Data ##
* Relational DB based implementationn (major changes): look at crunch_ideas/overview.md
* mutate/
	* _lh returns are not what you'd expect, pba_hlh_hdxret are the expanding returns from the first low to the highs of each intraday period to close

## Misc ##
* Use optparse for commandline parsing instead of getopt
* Use pathlib for filesystem path manipulation
